Article Title: Twin Builders make dreams come true
Author: By Elsa Kerschner, Postscript coordinator

Article Body:
Twin Builders, Albrightsville, is building dreams for people with the well constructed houses they are becoming known for. The twins of Twin Builders are Shawn and Scott Lignore.

The boys tested so high in mechanical ability at school that their parents were called. Consequently, when they attended the Carbon County Vo-Tech school they enrolled in carpentry for Shawn and plumbing for Scott. Upon graduation they stepped into waiting construction jobs. By 1989 they felt they were ready to step out on their own and asked their father for advice.

Money was raised to buy land to build a house. The house was sold before it was completed. That profit went into the next house and the fledgling business quickly expanded.

Parents Lee, office manager, and Rich, helper and advice-giver, are still involved in the business but expect to leave the twins on their own when Rich retires. Other family members also get credit for helping out such as sister Nicole Quavado who takes over the office when her parents go on vacation.

Commendations line the walls of the Route 903 office: "Thanks for getting things done ahead of schedule"; from a construction engineer, "Doing business with Twin Builders and watching our house take form has been a true pleasure"; from an architect, "I believe I can recognize the qualities of a good builder"; and "The entire family and staff made us feel welcome no matter what time of day we contacted you."

Especially pleasing to Lee is the fact that she holds keys to many of the residences Twin Builders have built so she can show them to potential customers. People for whom they have built houses return to ask for expansions or garages which says a lot for the quality of the original work. They will also call for recommendations for painters or people to do masonry work, putting their trust in Twin Builders.

"We have a good rapporte with suppliers," Lee says, which makes finishing jobs on time easier.

Twin Builders have a set of standard floor plans used as a basis for customizing. Wider windows or doors and extensions customize each house. "Chalets are popular right now as both primary and secondary homes," Lee says.

Twin Builders in not like a big business. "I show them the homes and if they are interested they talk with my sons. Our motto is 'The hand you shake is the hand that builds.' When I show a house the quality of the work sells the customer on Twin Builders."

Anyone signing a contract at this time will receive a free appliance package.

The family is proud that the company received the contract to build the rectory at St. Peter the Fisherman Catholic Church at Lake Hermany.

"We cater to people. You have to treat them with respect. We respected our sons and taught them to pass it on," Lee says.

In turn, they are passing respect for people on to their customers. For information call 717-722-9282 or 722-0496; or stop in the office 1 1/2 miles from the route 534 and 903 junction going toward Jim Thorpe.
